## Overview

Secure Data Advertisements

### Problem

Google and other large companies broker user information to advertisers for target audiences.
If there is a security data breach, this can expose private user data.

### Solution

Privately verify user data matches target audience data.
Prove user data JSON files using RISC Zero and SP1 zkVM Rust zero knowledge proving systems.

For context, RISC Zero and SP1 are both Rust zkVM development environments 
to avoid writing complex low level math circuits directly for zero knowledge applications by emulating RISC V commands.
